	<p> I hope you enjoy the combination of real live instruments and humans combined with electronic production techniques!</p>

<p>Here's another site with some of the same music: <a href="http://www.jurisdeveloper.com/#!music/ade5u">Juris Developer Music Page</a></p>
<p>This site is way better because it's much more visually attractive and contains a ton of information in an easy-to-navigate layout. It's also great because it contains payment processing allowing users to buy tracks. It's less good because it's made on Wix, which is cheating and results in some pretty ugly code and URLs.</p>
